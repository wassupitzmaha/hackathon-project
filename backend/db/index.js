// First, we're importing a helpful tool called 'pg' (think of it as a Swiss Army knife for working with PostgreSQL databases)

// It's much faster than hiring a new assistant every time we need something!
// Note: Pool automaticaly finds our environment variables in .env to establish the connection

// It's like setting up a telephone hotline for database queries

  // text: the question we're asking (in SQL language)
  // params: any specific details for the question
  // callback: what to do when we get an answer
  console.log("Hello from your tech_professions db!");
